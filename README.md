## 📌 What Is Reviewify?

Reviewify is an LLM-powered multi-tool agent that helps HR managers and team leads
automate the most time-consuming parts of the employee review process.
Instead of spending hours rewording rough notes into professional language,
you simply input bullet points and let the agent handle the rest.
